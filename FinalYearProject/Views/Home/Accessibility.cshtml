    <p>
        At <strong>BakesForAll</strong>, we are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users, including people with disabilities.
        Our goal is to provide an inclusive and user-friendly experience by adhering to the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Level AA
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have implemented several measures to support accessibility, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>High-contrast text and consistent focus indicators for clear navigation</li>
        <li>Keyboard accessibility across all interactive elements</li>
        <li>Descriptive alternative text for images</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML structure to support screen readers</li>
        <li>Clear instructions and ARIA labels for dynamic features like the search box</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We continually test and refine our site to improve accessibility and welcome user feedback.
        If you encounter any accessibility barriers or have suggestions, please contact us at
